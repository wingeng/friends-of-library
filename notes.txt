to delete an isbn number
  delete from isbn where isbn == '0356502759'";

to clear the media-list
sqlite3 isbn.db "update isbn set in_media = 0;"

The notion of being in the media list, is encoded by the field
in_media. A row is in the media list if the value is equaled to '1'.
All other values are considered not in list.

To clear the list we use the script 'clear_media-list.rb'.  This
script sets all rows with in_media == 1 to the 'max(in_media) + 1'. 

By doing this we have the property where we can undo previous to
previous media-list by setting the 'in_media' field back to 1.
(no redo tho)
